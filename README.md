## Google Site Verification (optional)

You can easily add
your [Google Site Verification HTML tag](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080#meta_tag_verification&zippy=%2Chtml-tag)
in AstroPaper using environment variable. This step is optional. If you don't add the following env variable, the
google-site-verification tag won't appear in the html `<head>` section.

```bash
# in your environment variable file (.env)
PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION=your-google-site-verification-value
```
